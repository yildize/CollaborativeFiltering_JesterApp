# Collaborative Filtering - Jester App

This app basically takes 10 rating input from the user, and based on these ratings suggests new jokes to the user. Algorithm outputs three jokes that user would not like along with three jokes that user might enjoy.

A kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/vikashrajluhaniwal/jester-17m-jokes-ratings-dataset) has been used to train the collaborative filtering model.

Here you can see the deployed app:
